DOM Project
HTML File (index.html):

It defines the structure and content of the web page.
It includes a <div> element with the id attribute set to "hero," which is the target element for DOM manipulation.
The external JavaScript file "script.js" is included using a <script> tag.
JavaScript File (script.js):

It selects the "hero" <div> element using document.getElementById("hero") and stores it in a variable called a.
It dynamically modifies the CSS styles of the "hero" <div> element, changing its background color, margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, width, and text color.
The project showcases how JavaScript can be used to change the appearance of HTML elements on a web page based on user interactions or other events. This is a fundamental concept in web development, allowing for dynamic and interactive user experiences on websites. Understanding how to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript is crucial for building modern, responsive web applications.
